    <h1>SealMe - Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to SealMe. By using our anonymous messaging platform, you agree to
      the following terms:
    </p>

    <h2>1. Usage</h2>
    <p>
      SealMe allows you to create and share chat room links for private,
      anonymous conversations. You agree not to use SealMe for any illegal,
      abusive, or harmful activities.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Account Needed</h2>
    <p>
      You are not required to create an account or share personal information to
      use this service.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Content Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      We do not monitor or moderate content in real time. You are responsible
      for the messages you send and receive. If you encounter abuse or illegal
      content, please discontinue use immediately and contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to restrict access to SealMe at any time for any
      misuse or breach of these terms.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Chat Deletion Policy</h2>
    <p>
      To maintain the privacy and integrity of conversations on SealMe, all chat
      rooms are automatically deleted at least 24 hours and at most 48 hours
      after creation. No manual intervention is required, and deleted chats
      cannot be recovered.
    </p>

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      SealMe does not collect names, emails, or any form of identifiable
      personal data from users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Temporary Data</h2>
    <p>
      Chat content may be stored temporarily to support active sessions. These
      are deleted as part of the automatic chat room removal process and are not
      associated with any user account.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Cookies & Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We may use anonymous cookies or analytics tools to understand app usage
      and improve performance. No personally identifiable data is collected or
      stored.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any concerns about privacy or data, contact us. We'll respond
      to legitimate inquiries as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This policy may be updated occasionally. Continued use of the app
      constitutes acceptance of the latest version.
